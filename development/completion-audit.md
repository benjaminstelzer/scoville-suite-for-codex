# PLAN-0001 completion audit

W-021–W-023 follow-up: see [workflow-context-fix.md](workflow-context-fix.md)
for the private context-load fixes, current package receipt, deterministic tests
and Terra Medium evidence. The package checks below retain their W-020 scope;
they are not checks of the later Workflow build. W-009 remains user-paused.

2026-09-21. Local implementation is delivered; the entire Plan is not complete
because W-009 remains explicitly paused with blocker HOST-FLAGOWNER. No resumed
configuration investigation, publication or live installation is authorized by
this audit. PLAN-0001 retains W-009 as its current paused item.

| Requirement | Evidence and current limit |
| --- | --- |
| W-001 suite migration | Both suite manifests and shared builder own packages. Original checkouts remain in the retained Z: archive; thirteen bundles remain under E: state. Initial 374-file byte comparison is historical evidence, not rerun against subsequently edited sources. |
| W-002 standalone helpers | Shared lifecycle source and manifest destinations; isolated-build coverage executes all six consumers with Python -I and tests drift. No installed sibling is needed. |
| W-003 visibility recovery | Exact identity, generation and predecessor completion govern continuation; visibility governs archival separately. Retained regression evidence and source inspection support this distinction. |
| W-007 gate/start messages | Original missing gate call and delivery-rule misinterpretation recorded in Plan Evidence; corrected prompt separates work tools from final delivery. Earlier installed fix is distinct from later uninstalled changes. |
| W-004 SCW/Ask RUN names | One formatter owns create arguments and retained title. Inspected tests cover roles, attempts, invalid input and legacy exact-ID continuity. Existing live names intentionally remain unchanged. |
| W-008 rename/alias | New private package name and source are canonical. workflow-rename.md documents that $scw works only after core loading; native alias discovery and new-name live launch remain unverified, as explicitly allowed by Acceptance. |
| W-005/W-012 Ask variants | Three template bases generate five packages. Astra high and SOL xhigh are manifest-owned and present in public packages; the user waived additional tests for Astra's default change. |
| W-010/W-013/W-015/W-016 family/README/distribution | Manifest-driven fragments, description sources and suite-only Workflow destination; inspected tests cover member addition, missing fragments, drift and private exclusion. |
| W-011 deferred archival | archive-recovery.md and canonical helper preserve a contiguous chain and exact receipts. This does not fix incomplete host listings or prove live archival while visibility is blocked. |
| W-018 selected comprehension gate | codex-cli-results.md closes the 64 cases selected by ADR-0008, with SOL and author acceptance and actual revision provenance. Not live integration proof. |
| W-019 projection recovery | result-projection-recovery.md records exact source/delivery comparison, bounded contract recovery, two focused checks and Luna projection-01. Real review findings remain changes_requested. |
| W-020 ten-run audit | divi5-workflow-ten-runs.md covers ten accepted units, ten coordinators and 23 children, exact identities, payloads, reconciled counters, thresholds, errors and recommendations. No live mutations. |

## Current package verification

Observed at this completion boundary, without new model tests:

- `python -B ../shared/build/verify_package_set.py --root
  "<workspace-root>/skills/public" --receipt
  "<workspace-root>/skills/public/build-receipt.json" --receipt
  "<workspace-root>/temp/2026-09-21-suite-migration/ask-astra-high/build-receipt.json"`
  returned valid:true, 13 packages, 188 files, no errors.
- `python -B development/build_suite.py --check-packages --output
  "<workspace-root>/temp/2026-09-21-suite-migration/workflow-projection-recovery-final"`
  returned valid:true, no errors. An initial invocation incorrectly passed the
  path directly after the flag and failed argument parsing; it checked nothing.
- Final native Plan validation after W-020 completion: 20 Work Items, eight
  Decisions, zero errors/warnings. Exact expected-byte delta was checked.

Package parity proves file correspondence, not host operation. No publication,
new Git commit or completed-plan claim follows from these checks. The remaining
W-009 scope requires the user's resume decision and a reliable flag-owner source;
do not alter app binaries or restart active work to obtain a green status.
