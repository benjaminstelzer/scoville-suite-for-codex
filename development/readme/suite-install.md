## Install the suite

Install the suite once in your agent host and it's available in all your
projects. Workflow starts directly in a saved Codex project.

Before running Workflow, [raise the agent limit in `config.toml`](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages/scoville-workflow-for-codex#agent-capacity)
as described in its installation instructions.

### New installation

Use this request in your agent host:

```text
Install and enable the complete suite for all my projects directly from {{ include: suite.repository }}.
```

### Upgrade from an earlier Scoville or Ask suite

Use this request in your agent host:

```text
Uninstall these Skills completely, including their settings, when present:
scoville-brainstorm, scoville-code-anti-ai-slop,
scoville-design-anti-ai-slop, scoville-handoff, scoville-plan,
scoville-research, scoville-scribe-anti-ai-slop,
scoville-ui-anti-ai-slop, scoville-wordpress-ui-backend-anti-ai-slop,
scoville-workflow-for-codex, scoville-workflow-codex,
ask-astra-for-review-for-codex, ask-sol-for-review-for-codex,
ask-claude-for-codex, ask-claude-and-astra-for-codex,
ask-claude-and-sol-for-codex.
Skip absent entries, leave unrelated Skills untouched, and keep no backup or settings migration. Then install and enable the complete suite for all my projects directly from {{ include: suite.repository }}.
```

</details>

Don't mix standalone and suite copies of the same Skill.

If your host can't install directly from GitHub, download this repository and
copy all the package directories inside it to the host's Skills folder. You
end up with the same complete suite and the same requirements.
