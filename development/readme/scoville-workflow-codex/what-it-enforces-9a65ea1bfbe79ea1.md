## What it enforces

- **Explicit activation.** Asking for implementation or delegation alone does not start Workflow.
- **Separate responsibilities.** The coordinator owns Plan updates, dispatch and accepted commits. Workers implement. Reviewers stay read-only.
- **One live checkout.** Tasks use the existing working state. Workflow does not create an isolated worktree without an explicit choice.
- **Cooperative write ownership.** A project guard grants one worker a bounded unit. Invalid state stops writes. This coordinates agents, not a filesystem lock against external tools.
- **Complete but bounded context.** Dispatch includes the selected Plan unit and its Decisions without truncation. Workers do not reconstruct it from a summary or reopen the Plan.
- **Configured routing.** Risk selects the model and effort. Unsupported required pairs block rather than silently falling back.
- **Independent review where needed.** Code and critical documentation changes require a fresh reviewer. Unresolved worker findings allow at most three repair workers before user input is required.
- **Measured rollover.** By default, the coordinator hands over at or above 33 percent after an accepted unit. Child roles hand over strictly above 66 percent at a natural boundary. Missing or stale measurements are not guessed. Both thresholds are configurable.
- **Verified cleanup.** Results are retained before children are archived. A rollover successor takes ownership before archiving its predecessor, whose turn must have ended. Exact task IDs matter, not titles or list visibility alone.
- **Accepted work before commit.** One unit commit includes its accepted changes and complete accumulated Plan state. Failed hooks and outstanding backup requirements are not bypassed.
- **A binding scope.** Without a narrower boundary, continue through the active Plan. Preserve explicit stops and decisions. Archiving a task is not cancelling it.

The canonical Plan owns progress. Workflow does not add a persistent Codex goal
or another continuation loop alongside its coordinator.
