## What it enforces

- **Responsibility.** The visible chat maintains the Plan; executors implement
  and reviewers assess. At most one executor writes in the shared checkout.
- **Bounded work.** Released Step groups finish checks, due review and corrections
  before later groups start. Work Item context does not expand assignments.
- **Model choices.** Configured executor, reviewer and explorer models and effort are respected.
  Unsupported settings stop dependent work rather than being substituted.
- **Continuity.** The same chat continues after compaction from concise Plan
  state, known child identities, completed effects and open decisions.
- **Visible decisions.** The manager asks necessary questions directly. Stops
  preserve unfinished work; completion requires accepted scope and quiescent writers.

Workflow activates explicitly and commits only when authorized.
The [operations reference](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/blob/main/packages/scoville-workflow-for-codex/scoville-workflow-for-codex/references/operations.md)
contains execution, review and stop behavior.
