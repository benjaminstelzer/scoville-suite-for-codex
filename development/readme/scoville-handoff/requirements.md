## What it enforces

- **Explicit transfer.** A handoff starts when you request one. Preparing it is
  read-only and does not advance the task.
- **Faithful context.** Decisions, permissions, ownership and blockers survive
  the transfer. Unknown results stay unknown, and secrets stay out.
- **A useful next action.** The prompt tells the next session where to resume
  and how to recognize completion.

A targeted GPT-6 Luna High test turned a preference into a requirement. Check
that distinction in a generated handoff. Later testing has not disproved the
observation.
