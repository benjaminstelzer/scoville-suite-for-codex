# Changelog


## v2.1.9 - 2026-09-28

- Recognize explicit requests to run Scoville Workflow without requiring the dollar-prefixed Skill name. Generic plan execution, mentions and questions still do not start it.
- Keep coordination in the calling chat from the first dispatch, with its manager title set before a worker starts.



## v2.1.8 - 2026-09-28

- Explicitly end Workflow when its requested scope is complete. Later requests return to normal assistance until Workflow is explicitly activated again.



## v2.1.7 - 2026-09-28

- Continue unfinished Workflow tasks with only the remaining work, relevant constraints and retained evidence, instead of resending the complete Work Item.



## v2.1.6 - 2026-09-28

- Rename the Workflow coordinator before its first worker starts and use clear chat titles such as SC · MNGR · 1 · PLAN-0001.
- Use the same middle-dot separators in worker, reviewer and Ask chat titles, without hash signs before counters.



## v2.1.5 - 2026-09-28

- Start Workflow from its Skill entry prompt in the current chat, without a setup gate or a separate launcher coordinator. Setup remains optional for inspecting or changing settings.


## v2.1.4 - 2026-09-28

- Add an edition guide and Skill overview, and collapse upgrade and development details.
- Clarify examples and remove repeated name explanations.
- Align Workflow review and handoff descriptions, add a recorded sequence and historical evidence, and consolidate Codex limitations.

## v2.1.3 - 2026-09-28

- Keep Code safeguards proportionate to actual consequences and preserve useful output when a later step fails.
- Give UI ownership of interface wording, terminology and unsettled task structure.
- Check the affected composition and responsive behavior after UI changes.


## v2.1.2 - 2026-09-28

- Deliver rollover confirmations and coordination requests to their intended chats through native messages.


## v2.1.1 - 2026-09-28


- Start Workflow directly in a saved project after installing the suite, without a project setup step or an AGENTS.md block.
- Check coordinator context at worker handoffs and split oversized unfinished Steps without changing their acceptance criteria.
- Review completed product fixes before dependent work and reuse earlier reviews for unchanged code.

- Split unfinished Plan Steps without changing scope, acceptance criteria or completed evidence.
- Keep pure visual concepts outside the WordPress implementation adapter.

## v2.1.0 - 2026-09-27

- Run Workflow through direct handoffs and ordinary worker results. Review findings start a new worker, and chat numbers identify the reviewed work.
- Explain invalid helper inputs with the expected value and a concrete correction.
- Keep Plans and handoffs focused on the facts needed to execute, verify or continue.

## v2.0.6 - 2026-09-27

- Review completed Workflow Work Items at the project-defined boundary and reuse available workers for corrections.
- Keep formal Plan updates and related test repairs within their existing Work Item, with concise evidence and retained history.

## v2.0.5 - 2026-09-27

- Explain how to keep personal conventions in `AGENTS.md` for Codex or `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code.

## v2.0.4 - 2026-09-27

- Set Codex Workflow rollover defaults to 40% for coordinators and 60% for workers, reviewers and fixers.
- Check context before commands expected to add substantial context, keep full logs and exit status, and read large output selectively.
- Group related coordinator state updates while preserving dispatch and rollover recovery.

## v2.0.3 - 2026-09-27

- Archive blocked Workflow workers when they are replaced. Keep a worker open when it will continue after clarification.

## v2.0.2 - 2026-09-26

- Keep per-unit Workflow role numbering, stop work at context handoff, and preserve message authorization and exact return identities.
- Separate Handoff preferences from requirements and name blocking Plan decisions before the action they prevent.
- Preserve existing file encoding and line endings, report individual check failures, and keep Workflow cursors and delegated ownership current.
- Clarify Handoff recovery, final Plan completion, UI evidence ownership and Workflow context boundaries.
- Resolve explicit Ask adviser presets and retain precise mismatch and Claude-timeout recovery state.
- Reuse the unchanged Plan Viewer v1.3.3 binaries and checksums for the compatible Plan package.

## v2.0.1 - 2026-09-26

- Preserve existing user authorization through native Workflow and Ask handoffs, and report answers that could not be delivered.
- Respect host-required progress waits while keeping internal coordination free of extra polling and archival checks.

## v2.0.0 - 2026-09-25

- Group related consecutive Workflow Steps, receive results through native messages and continue unfinished work through compact context handoffs.
- Keep native Ask advisers in separate chats with S-ASK model titles, without a lifecycle helper between Codex and its task tools.
- Bundle Plan Viewer v1.3.3 and build its Windows, Linux and macOS assets with one checksum manifest from the suite workflow.
- Replace the old Code and UI package names, combine Ask variants, add Setup and simplify Plan and Workflow configuration.
- Install General and Codex suites through short migration prompts that remove only listed old Skills before a fresh complete installation.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-09-24

- Build general and Codex suites from one manifest; keep Python replacement procedures only in the general edition.
- Require complete suite installations from their own packages; standalone Skills remain independent.
- Add shared writing profiles with independent Plan and Workflow configuration.
- Preserve exact plan-point text and bind additional context and writing rules into Workflow dispatches.
- Bundle the compatible Plan v1.8.0 and Workflow v0.5.0 pair. Plan Viewer v1.3.2 remains unchanged.

## v1.0.10 - 2026-09-24

- Keep High risk classification for concrete planning or risk review of high-impact operations, even when execution is deferred.
- Make Workflow operation routing and helper use explicit for the coordinator.

## v1.0.9 - 2026-09-23

- Resolve WORK and REVIEW pairs from the configurable route table and raise the second and third repair attempts along its WORK rows.
- Bundle project-contract and coordinator-guard verification with bounded Work Item selection in one preflight helper.
- Require Python 3.11+ during suite installation; Workflow stops an affected operation when a required helper cannot run.
- Document Plan's no-Python dispatch-unit selection and Decision-batch hashing routes.

## v1.0.7 - 2026-09-23

- Route new high-class Workflow work to SOL 6 XHigh with Astra 6 High review, and raise ultra-high work and review to Astra 6 High and XHigh.

## v1.0.6 - 2026-09-23

- Route new Workflow work through SOL 6 and Astra 6 with the updated reasoning levels for every class.

## v1.0.5 - 2026-09-23

- Route new low-class Workflow execution to Luna 6 High and its review to SOL 6 Low.

## v1.0.4 - 2026-09-23

- Recognize a verified parking prompt and the complete writer assignment when Codex delivers both in one native turn, while blocking duplicate or conflicting assignments.

## v1.0.3 - 2026-09-23

- Keep Workflow's dispatch binding stable when the writer moves from pending to active, while retaining the separate target and guard checks.

## v1.0.2 - 2026-09-23

- Route new Workflow tasks through Luna 6, SOL 6, and Astra 6; remove Terra from the default routing table.
- Verify builder assignments after the native task envelope escapes HTML characters or removes the final newline.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-09-23

- Stop Workflow workers before project access unless their native task carries
  the complete builder-generated dispatch contract for the assigned role and
  execution unit.
- Let established codebases keep their local conventions. For Greenfield work,
  start with the smallest coherent responsibility-based layout without
  prescribing an architecture or directory tree.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-22

- Install the Scoville Skills together from one suite or use individual
  distributions for the concerns you need.
- Include Scoville Workflow as a Codex-only Beta, available only in the suite.
  It coordinates Plan execution, reviews, repairs and context handovers.
- Include the renamed WordPress UI Backend specialist. Replace an existing
  `wordpress-backend-ui` installation with
  `scoville-wordpress-ui-backend-anti-ai-slop`.
- Bundle runtime helpers inside each Skill so installed packages need neither
  the suite source tree nor a shared directory.
