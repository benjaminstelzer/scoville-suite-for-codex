# Scoville Project Context Cleanup

Project rules grow with every new note. Repeated instructions and stale context
make the next task harder to follow. Scoville Project Context Cleanup adds or
revises the rules you request in `AGENTS.md` and context in `PROJECT_INDEX.md`,
placing them where they belong and preserving their meaning.

Suitable text stays unchanged. Necessary scope, exceptions and safeguards stay
explicit, even when they need more words.

## How it works

- Resolve the target file and read its relevant governing rules.
- Check the addition for useful project information, duplicates and conflicts.
- Place concise wording in the affected structure, with conditions and exceptions together.
- Inspect the saved change and use the record owner's checks where required.

## What it enforces

- Requested additions and cleanup stay within the named project-context files.
- Scope, conditions, permissions, safeguards and necessary reasons survive edits.
- Existing formats and record owners remain responsible for fields and lifecycle.
- Suitable text stays unchanged, and unresolved material choices are asked directly.

## What it costs

- Reading the target, relevant rules and saved edits takes additional tokens and time.

## How it was developed

- The structure follows current OpenAI and Anthropic guidance on relevant context and conditional references.
- Targeted Codex Luna cases checked file edits, exceptions, unresolved permissions, index formats and repeated requests.

## Compatibility

Requires a frontier model from the Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus families,
version 5.0 or newer. Targeted behavior cases also ran with Codex Luna.

The host needs access to the project files and permission for requested writes.
The Skill uses no scripts, services or network. Its shared writing reference
is included in every built package.

Developed and tested in Codex. Other Agent Skills hosts have not been tested.
Implicit selection depends on the host and task, not file-access monitoring.

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.
Start Workflow by asking for it explicitly.

## Install

Install this Skill with the complete released suite from
[the suite packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Use the edition for your host and preserve unrelated Skills and settings.
The package is distributed through the suite, without a separate Skill repository.

## How to use

Ask the agent to add or revise project rules:

```text
Add this to the project rules: edit schemas/ and regenerate docs/generated/.
```

Or name `AGENTS.md` or `PROJECT_INDEX.md` explicitly. Requests such as
“Füge das den Projektregeln hinzu” use the same scope.
At a clear project root, this can create a missing `AGENTS.md`. A missing index
follows the requested format; a text addition alone does not create a Plan.

For an explicit call, use `$scoville-project-context-cleanup`. A file mention,
ordinary README edit or routine Plan progress does not request cleanup.
