# Scoville Plan

Scoville Plan keeps goals, decisions and progress in the repository so longer
work survives the next conversation. You can see what is done, what remains
and why a choice was made without reconstructing it from chat history.

Use it for work with dependencies or several sessions. Settle the requirements
and acceptance criteria before implementation, get independent advice where
useful, and revise the Plan when the facts change. A contained fix can stay small.

Scoville measures chili heat. Plan keeps the direction from being diluted by
one more perfectly reasonable detour.

[Plan Viewer](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/releases/latest)
shows these records on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## How it works

- Use the repository's existing planning system and relevant Plan, Work Items and Decisions.
- Check current sources before starting the next item.
- Edit Markdown and YAML records with observed Step progress and any additional Instructions.
- Record evidence before completion, preserve accepted history and validate the records.

## What it enforces

- **Resumable work.** Goals, ordered Steps, dependencies and the current position
  stay explicit in the project's records.
- **Decisions with an owner.** Confirmed choices are recorded. Open questions
  remain proposals and block only the work that depends on them.
- **Evidence before completion.** Finished means acceptance was checked.
  Changes of direction preserve completed work and relevant history.

Edit records from one session at a time. Concurrent edits need reconciliation.
See the [full instructions](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/blob/main/scoville-plan/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Maintaining records takes tokens and time. It pays for continuity on dependent work. A small fix rarely needs a large Plan.

## How it was developed

Real project records shaped the resumable work units and progress checks.
The useful lesson was to keep decisions and accepted results close to the
work they explain, without turning routine updates into more work items.

## Compatibility

Requires Codex, repository read/write access and Python 3.11+ for the bundled helpers. Use a Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus model (5.0+).

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## Configuration

### Model choices for Workflow

When using Scoville Workflow for Codex, you can request a model and reasoning
level for a Step. Otherwise Workflow uses its configured routing. Scoville
Setup shows or saves those settings. Unsupported model/effort combinations
stop the affected operation instead of silently changing your choice.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Plan to create an implementation plan for migrating the billing schema, including dependencies and acceptance criteria.
```

```text
Create a detailed repository-owned implementation plan for the billing migration so workers can execute each point without this conversation.
```

State the result you want and the constraints that matter. Plan records the
work, dependencies and acceptance criteria. It does not dispatch agents.

### Progress and decisions

New Plan points use ordered Steps with explicit progress:

```text
1. [status: done] Write the draft.
2. [status: in_progress] Review it against the brief.
3. [status: todo] Deliver the reviewed text.
```

The agent records observed progress, keeps open decisions visible and asks
before dependent work. Older unmarked Steps remain valid, with unknown progress.
Completed Steps still need the Plan point's acceptance checks.

To correct an existing record, ask: "Review and correct PLAN-0001." The agent
checks the evidence and actual result before changing progress. Inspection
without a correction request stays read-only.

### Companion app

[Plan Viewer downloads](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/releases/latest)
include a portable EXE and installers for Windows x64, DMGs and zipped apps for
macOS Apple Silicon and Intel, and a portable binary, AppImage, DEB and RPM for
Linux x64.

Open a project containing `PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `docs/plans` and `docs/decisions`.
The read-only Viewer shows current work, Step progress and decisions, refreshing
automatically while active. Removing a project from its list leaves the
repository untouched.

Portable copies keep the project list in `scoville-plan-viewer.xml` beside the
application. An installed copy in a read-only folder uses the platform's user
configuration directory. Keep the Skill and Viewer updated together: older
readers do not understand all current progress fields.

The [record guide](scoville-plan/references/edit.md) covers Step annotations,
field formats and helper commands. Plan uses `format_version: 1`.
