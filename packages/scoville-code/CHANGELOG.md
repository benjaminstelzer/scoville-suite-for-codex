# Changelog

## v2.0.0 - 2026-09-25

- Rename the Skill and installation directory to scoville-code.

## v1.0.36 - 2026-09-24

- Keep concrete planning and risk review for high-impact operations in the High risk class when execution is deferred.
- Use Scoville Plan as the record owner only when it is independently available and applicable.

## v1.0.35 - 2026-09-23

- Follow established project conventions for existing code unless they
  conflict with the requested outcome, safety or a binding contract.
- Start Greenfield code with the smallest coherent responsibility-based layout
  and split at real domain, I/O, integration or state boundaries. Keep the
  2,000-line default as a backstop, not an architecture target.

## v1.0.34 - 2026-09-22

- Apply engineering guardrails to Plan entries even when no code changes.
- Make reference selection explicit for implementation, validation and
  risk classification without granting permission to perform deferred work.

## v1.0.33 - 2026-09-20

- Simplify operation routing and stop dependent work when a material decision
  remains unresolved.

## v1.0.32 - 2026-09-20

- Make repository authority, Develop-mode retention, material-choice blocking,
  and durable completion requirements explicit.
- Clarify that discovering another family Skill does not activate it, while
  independently authorized work continues and a user opt-out applies only to
  the excluded Skill.

## v1.0.31 - 2026-09-19

- Bound broad reads before content is returned, and filter required large
  sources locally instead of draining truncated output or listing an entire
  tree.
- Derive boundary expectations from an agreed contract or independent
  consumer, prove negative tests reach the named failure operation, and cover
  every independently affected consumer variant without inventorying unrelated
  neighbors.

## v1.0.26 - 2026-09-12

- Bound source searches and recover only relevant missing output after truncation. Explicitly requested traces and generated sources remain in scope.

## v1.0.25 - 2026-09-11

- Classify purely editorial work by its actual effects even when the request calls it a migration. Real migrations, including audits and dry runs, retain their High risk classification.

## v1.0.23 - 2026-09-10

- Allow a demonstrated cause to justify inspection of related inputs, state, or
  consumers without turning a contained change into a broad rewrite.
- Keep mocked behavior separate from evidence for an actual integration
  boundary.
- Diagnose repeated causal failures across checks without weakening stop rules,
  permissions, or acceptance criteria.

## v1.0.18 - 2026-09-01

- Added a 2,000-line ceiling for hand-written source files, with project
  precedence and exceptions for generated, declarative, vendored, or narrowly
  patched legacy files.
- Added language-independent guidance for domain boundaries, subsystem
  directories, dependency direction, state and resource ownership, runtime
  compatibility, and evidence-based abstraction.
- Reject metric gaming, fake file splits, and unrequested refactors whose only
  purpose is to satisfy a size number.

## v1.0.11 - 2026-08-11

- Made every Scoville Skill optional and independently usable. Discovering a
  sibling does not install or activate it.

## v1.0.6 - 2026-08-08

- Let Scoville Plan own durable Plans, Work Items, and Decisions when it is
  independently available and applicable.
- Keep the repository's existing record owner when Plan is absent or
  inapplicable.
- Do not cross an explicit proposal-acceptance boundary through an unattended
  implementation assumption.

## v1.0.3 - 2026-08-06

- Generalized planning language so Code works with any authoritative project
  plan without depending on one planning product.
- Map independently resumable outcomes to Work Items while keeping
  implementation, review, testing, and documentation steps inside the same
  behavior-complete item.
- Reduce repeated large diagnostics to a stable failure signature and the
  meaningful delta after the first complete capture.
- Treat aggregate evidence as stale when later code, tests, or harness changes
  affect the completion claim.
- Require decisive checks to cover every explicit acceptance behavior and each
  concrete coupling that can make a required path behave differently.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-08-03

### Rename to Scoville Code Anti-AI-Slop

- Renamed the Skill from `scoville-anti-ai-coding-slop` to
  `scoville-code-anti-ai-slop`.

### Migration

- Replace an installation under `scoville-anti-ai-coding-slop/` with
  `scoville-code-anti-ai-slop/`. Do not keep both names installed.

### Runtime-neutral operation and validation floor - 2026-07-26

- Keep internal modes, risk flags, and framing questions out of user-facing
  output.
- When a changed symbol is used elsewhere, require at least one check through a
  real use instead of validating only its owner.
- Allow one documented setup step after an infrastructure failure before one
  substitute check.
- In projects without version control, read before overwriting and preserve
  unrelated content because edits may be irreversible.
- Ask one specific material question after all independent work is complete. In
  unattended work, state the necessary assumption instead of blocking.
- Inspect the complete scoped change and working-tree state once before
  completion, using the facilities available in the current runtime.

### Durable handoff and local code style - 2026-07-22

- Preserve binding constraints and unrecorded material decisions in compacted
  or handed-off work, then reconcile the record with current instructions and
  version-control state when resuming.
- Match the surrounding code's naming, idioms, error handling, comments,
  annotations, and test style.
- Comment only when the code cannot express an important constraint. Do not
  narrate the edit or address a reviewer through comments.
- Report unrelated pre-existing findings only when they could change the user's
  next action.

### Validation stop semantics - 2026-07-21

- After one infrastructure failure, allow one different substitute check. If it
  cannot prove the behavior, stop and report the result as unverified.
- Treat decisive evidence as terminal unless another changed behavior, named
  risk, or higher-priority requirement remains open.
- Open another validation cycle only when the final inspection finds a concrete
  defect that is then fixed.

### Goal-first rewrite - 2026-07-20

- Rebuilt the Skill around the requested observable outcome. Correctness,
  structure, and validation constrain delivery but do not replace it.
- Added Advise, Review, Explore, Develop, and Harden modes while keeping
  structural and high-risk flags independent of change size.
- Presume failed checks are substantive and caused by the change until evidence
  shows otherwise.
- Stop after two failed attempts against the same check, reread the owner
  contract, and change or narrow the approach.
- Treat retained experiments as Develop work and validate them accordingly.
- Removed Skill-owned fallback plan and decision files. Existing project records
  remain canonical.

### Runtime and user precedence - 2026-07-18

- Resolve planning through user instructions, runtime facilities, and project
  conventions before considering a temporary fallback.
- Keep subagent planning ephemeral when the subagent cannot access the caller's
  plan owner.
- Skip written plans for tiny work unless the user or runtime requires one.

### Bounded discovery and validation - 2026-07-16

- Add broader validation only for a named structural or high-risk concern, an
  explicit project rule, or a user requirement.
- Do not rerun an unchanged failed command or continue similar checks after
  decisive evidence.
- Use exact task paths and targeted symbol or filename searches first. Expand
  only when inspected evidence leaves a material owner, boundary, or validation
  question unresolved.
- Stop locating once the source and directly relevant test establish the
  canonical owner.

### Adaptive, risk-proportionate workflow - 2026-07-13

- Inherit user and repository workflows concern by concern and use fallback
  rules only where the project is silent.
- Separate change size from structural and high-risk classification so small
  edits stay lightweight without weakening safety or evidence requirements.
- Organize work around behavior-complete outcomes, real stop conditions,
  focused evidence, final review, and explicit residual risk.

### Structural execution and review gate - 2026-07-10

- Added explicit Change, Review, Advisory, and Non-engineering operations for
  code and engineering artifacts.
- Added structural checks for misleading wrappers, silent fallbacks, lossy
  boundaries, state published before durable work, duplicate owners,
  responsibility growth, speculative abstraction, mode creep,
  implementation-mirroring tests, and incomplete scaffolding.
- Added owner, boundary, atomicity, dependency, failure, completion, and
  residual-risk gates.

### Structural quality beyond green tests - 2026-07-07

- Added pre-edit and post-edit structural review so passing tests alone cannot
  approve a harmful change.
- Added whole-diff review for atomicity, boundary loss, misleading wrappers,
  file-growth signals, and failure-mode coverage.

### Execution-focused quality gate - 2026-07-03

- Replaced the original checklist with an execution loop for locating the
  canonical owner, making a scoped change, validating behavior, inspecting the
  result, and reporting remaining risk.
- Added read-before-edit, conflict detection, dependency approval, fail-first
  defect proof, narrow-to-broad checks, and repository-owned version-control
  policy.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-06-29

- Added the first goal-oriented engineering quality gate for AI-assisted code
  changes and reviews.
