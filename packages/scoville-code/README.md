# Scoville Code

A coding agent can produce passing tests while missing the behavior you asked
for. Scoville Code connects the requested result, the existing implementation
and the evidence that a change works.

Use it to develop, diagnose, review or remove code. It directs the agent to find
the cause, respect the project's architecture and check the affected behavior
with effort proportionate to the task.

The name comes from the Scoville scale, which originally measured chili heat through dilution.
Here, the heat is the requested behavior and the evidence that it works, kept clear through implementation and testing.

## How it works

- Identify the outcome, responsible code, risks and decisive check before editing.
- Read relevant code, callers and tests. Expand the investigation when evidence requires it.
- Fix the cause within the existing architecture and requested scope.
- Check the changed behavior and report what the evidence actually proves.
- Investigate failures without weakening guarantees. Revise obsolete assertions only for an approved change to the expected behavior. Reassess after two failed corrections of the same cause.
- Inspect the complete change, report remaining gaps and stop checking when further evidence would not change the decision.

## What it enforces

- **The requested result.** Plans, tests and refactors support the outcome.
  Completion requires the behavior itself.
- **Project conventions.** Changes follow the project's architecture, records,
  terminology and workflow.
- **Proportionate checks.** Verification addresses concrete failure risks.
  Broader security, migration or release checks follow the task and project rules.
- **Supported claims.** Reports distinguish observed results, failed checks
  and unverified behavior.
- **Root-cause correction.** Repeated failure triggers a reassessment of the approach.
- **Navigable code.** Existing conventions and module boundaries guide changes.
  New projects start with a small layout organized by responsibility. The
  default limit of 2,000 lines per source file permits justified exceptions.
- **Necessary questions.** Ask when a choice changes behavior, authority, cost,
  reversibility or scope. Resolve ordinary details from the project.
- **Your conventions.** Project instructions take priority. Defaults apply only
  to a wholly new project. Keep personal conventions outside the installed
  Skill and reference them from `AGENTS.md` (Codex) or `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code)
  to preserve them across updates.
  See the [customization guide](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-code#your-own-conventions).
- **Useful completion reports.** State changed behavior, validation, unresolved
  failures and relevant repository state.

The full instructions are in [SKILL.md](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/blob/main/packages/scoville-code/scoville-code/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Source inspection and checks use more tokens and time than an immediate patch.

## How it was developed

- Real engineering tasks and their histories supplied cases involving wrong-cause fixes, missed outcomes and repeated checks.
- Targeted simulations and SkillOpt informed instruction revisions, with tests checking that required behavior survived.

## Compatibility

A current Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus model is recommended. Luna was also used
in testing.

The host must read the Skill's references and run the project's own build, test
and check commands in a shell. Version control is optional. The Skill bundles
no scripts and requires no network access. It was developed for Codex and
Claude Code. Other hosts are untested.

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.
Start Workflow by asking for it explicitly.

## Install

### Install this Skill

Install this Skill as part of the complete suite from
[the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Every member must be installed and enabled. Do not fetch or substitute packages
from individual Skill repositories. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. See the
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
for host-specific locations.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

Get the complete suite from the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Code to analyze this codebase for correctness, ownership and missing validation. Report prioritized findings.
```

```text
Analyze this codebase for defects and hidden failure paths. Support findings with code evidence and keep the analysis read-only.
```

### Starting a new project

For a wholly new project, Scoville Code uses
[`references/project-conventions.md`](scoville-code/references/project-conventions.md)
for choices the project instructions leave open. Its defaults follow the
language and framework, with a small `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` and `scripts/`
layout where appropriate. Directories are added when needed. Tests may sit
beside code when the framework expects it. Existing projects retain their
organization, including during refactors or module additions.

### Your own conventions

You can edit the bundled reference, but a Skill update can replace that edit.
For conventions you want to keep across updates, maintain a Markdown file
outside the Skill installation and explicitly reference it in your global or
project `AGENTS.md` (Codex) or `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code). For example, add
this to the applicable file at the project root:

```markdown
### Greenfield project conventions

For the initial organization of a wholly new project, first follow this
project's explicit requirements, then read `docs/project-conventions.md`
for my additional folder and filename conventions. Use Scoville Code's
defaults only for choices neither source settles. Do not apply this
fallback to additions or refactors in an existing project.
```

Create the file with your conventions. Relative paths resolve from the
referring `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. A shared personal file can use an absolute path.
The agent reads the explicitly referenced file and reports it if unavailable.

Project-specific instructions and framework requirements still apply.
