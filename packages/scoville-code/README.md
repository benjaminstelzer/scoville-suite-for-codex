# Scoville Code

Passing tests are useful. Passing tests for the wrong behavior, rather less so.
Scoville Code keeps implementation, debugging and review tied to the result you
asked for: find the cause, work with the existing architecture and check what
actually changed.

Scoville measures chili heat. Code aims for sharper reasoning before a small
fix acquires its own framework.

## How it works

- Establish the requested result and find the code responsible for it.
- Fix the cause within the project's architecture and your authorized scope.
- Check the affected behavior and relevant performance costs.
- Reassess failed fixes, report remaining limits and stop when further checks
  would no longer change the decision.

## What it enforces

- **Work that serves the request.** Refactors, safeguards and tests need a
  concrete purpose. The agent asks about material choices and settles routine
  details from the project.
- **Your conventions.** Existing architecture and project rules take precedence.
  New projects start with a small structure organized by responsibility.
- **Evidence that fits the change.** Check the behavior, preserve guarantees and
  distinguish observed results from what remains unverified.

Keep personal conventions outside the installed Skill so updates preserve them.
See the [customization guide](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-code#your-own-conventions)
and [full instructions](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-code/blob/main/scoville-code/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Reading relevant code and checking behavior takes tokens and time. The extra work is aimed at avoiding fixes that merely look finished.

## How it was developed

The cases come from real engineering tasks: wrong-cause fixes, missed outcomes
and checks repeated without new information. They shaped the focus on useful
evidence. Selected comparisons do not establish a general performance gain.

## Compatibility

Developed for Codex and Claude Code with reference access and a shell for the project's own checks. Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus (5.0+) are recommended. Luna 6 with High reasoning has passing results in selected practical Code tasks in Codex, but some practical checks and one abstract instruction-recall check did not pass. These checks do not establish reliable use across Code tasks or on other model routes or hosts.

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## Configuration

### Your own conventions

You can edit the bundled [conventions](scoville-code/references/project-conventions.md),
but the next Skill update may overwrite them. To keep your conventions, maintain a Markdown file outside the
Skill installation and reference it explicitly from your global or project
`AGENTS.md`. For example, add this to
the file at the project root:

```markdown
### Greenfield project conventions

For the initial organization of a wholly new project, first follow this
project's explicit requirements, then read `docs/project-conventions.md`
for my additional folder and filename conventions. Use Scoville Code's
defaults only for choices neither source settles. Do not apply this
fallback to additions or refactors in an existing project.
```

Then create the file with your conventions. Relative paths are resolved from
the `AGENTS.md` that references them, and a personal file
shared across projects can use an absolute path. The agent reads the
referenced file and tells you if it can't find it.

Project-specific instructions and framework requirements still apply.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Code to analyze this codebase for correctness, ownership and missing validation. Report prioritized findings.
```

```text
Use Scoville Code to fix the failing checkout total when a coupon and free shipping combine. Find the cause, change the responsible code and verify the corrected case.
```

```text
Use Scoville Code to add CSV export to the orders page. Follow the existing structure and verify the exported fields and values against a representative local test order.
```

### Starting a new project

In a brand-new project, Scoville Code falls back on
[`references/project-conventions.md`](scoville-code/references/project-conventions.md)
for anything the project instructions leave open. Those defaults follow the
language and framework, with a small `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` and `scripts/`
layout where it fits. Directories are only added when they're needed, and
tests can sit next to the code if the framework expects that. Existing
projects keep their organization, even during refactors or when modules are
added.
