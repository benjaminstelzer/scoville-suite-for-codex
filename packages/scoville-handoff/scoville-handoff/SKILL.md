description: Create a factual continuation prompt for an explicitly requested transfer to another agent or session, including Scoville Handoff or "handoff to a new session". Ordinary Plan maintenance belongs to Plan. Do not activate for ordinary summaries, shortening, low context, wrapping up, or ending a session.

# Scoville Handoff

Give the receiver accurately labeled context to continue safely from one
copy-ready snapshot. An explicit transfer applies even when work is empty,
completed or not started. Without a transfer request, perform the requested
task without a handoff. If future reuse is requested but transfer intent is
unclear, ask one question before reading sources or producing a handoff.
When asked to explain or assess a hypothetical handoff, answer that question.
Produce the continuation artifact only for a requested transfer of an actual
task.

## Read within the transfer scope

Any already required and authorized pre-transfer update belongs to its active
owner, such as Plan for Step status, and must finish before Handoff starts.
The transfer request grants no additional editing authority.

Use task facts already established in the conversation. Additional reads are
limited to sources explicitly named or already established as task sources in
the conversation, optional read-only version-control inspection, and the
[continuation template](assets/continuation-prompt.md). Do not search for more
sources. Throughout this workflow, do not advance the task: no edits, builds,
tests, probes, dummy or other task commands, unrelated reads, stat or list
operations, or external effects.
Missing facts do not authorize additional actions. Only for preparing and
delivering this handoff, interpreter discovery, temporary artifact writes,
size checks and complete-file publication are permitted. This exception
grants no task edits, tests or other task commands.

For each source, retain its exact path and whether the read was complete,
partial or failed. Finish a truncated read through its missing range or cursor.
Retry a failed range once only if the error is plausibly transient. Stop on no
progress or repeated failure; explicit user read limits take precedence.
Complete permitted recovery before rendering rather than assigning that read
to the receiver. After recovery stops or a read limit prevents it, preserve the
usable facts and record recovery, gaps and unread ranges beside that source.
A partial source is not wholly unavailable.
Conflicting source revisions and material unread ranges remain explicit
blockers for receiver verification.

## Preserve continuation facts

Read the [shared writing rules](references/writing.md) when composing the
continuation prompt. They govern wording, not permission to read more task
sources. Select the relevant continuation facts below.

Capture the goal, deliverable, acceptance, scope and authority, canonical
owners, user-owned changes, accepted decisions, active work and running handles,
observed evidence and its limits, blockers, hazards and next safe action.
Preserve exact IDs, paths, commits, URLs, commands, errors, quoted decisions,
assumptions, unknowns and time-sensitive details where needed for continuation.
Transfer known material facts, not just pointers or instructions to reread them.
The handoff request itself is not a task decision. Keep preferences and proposals
distinct from requirements and accepted decisions.

Use `unknown` for missing information and `none known` when no instances are
known, such as no known blockers. Neither proves absence. Set `Status:
not_started` only when the conversation or an explicitly named or already
established task source establishes it; otherwise a missing status stays
`unknown`.

For file-based work, use the task working directory established by the
conversation or an explicitly named or already established canonical project
source. A task repository already verified during the work is sufficient; the
user need not name it again. If no task location is established, include
`Working directory: unknown`. Runtime CWD alone does not establish the task
location. Include temporary workspace or host state only when established as
task state.

Replace every secret value with `[redacted]` before composing any response,
including warnings, quotations and redaction instructions. For each established
secret-bearing variable in scope, retain its name with `[redacted]` as the value;
never omit its name merely because the value is secret.

For a tight output limit, remove repetition and unrelated history first, then
shorten explanations. Preserve authority, ownership, hazards, evidence limits
and the safe first step. An explicit lossless request preserves every in-scope
non-secret fact. If required content still cannot fit, publish the complete
unchanged fenced artifact through the shared complete-file route. Return its
absolute path, SHA-256 and an instruction to verify the hash and read the
entire file before continuing.

## Compose and check the prompt

Fill the continuation template, keeping its four H2 sections, the meaning of
every Receiver Instruction and three Resume Steps. Keep the template's
Receiver Instructions intact apart from translation and secret redaction;
they are required instructions, not optional State labels. Use the user's requested
output language, otherwise the conversation language. Translate headings,
labels and Receiver Instructions consistently; preserve technical identifiers,
literal markers such as `unknown`, and exact quotations except secret values.
Use one outer Markdown fence with at least four backticks and more backticks
than any run inside the prompt; match its opening and closing length, including
when saving the artifact to a file.
Include every Objective field. Under State, always preserve Status and the
required continuation facts, including relevant unknowns. Other template labels
are optional; omit empty or inapplicable categories. Name each source once beside
its facts and identify conversation facts as such. Repeat a fact only when a
hazard or first step needs it.

Step 1 resolves the first blocker, otherwise recovers in-flight work, otherwise
states the next safe action. If the goal is unknown, or the acceptance is unknown
and the next action depends on it, Step 1 asks for it before recovering a running
command. Make the remaining steps concrete and end with an
observable completion criterion. Active or incompletely accepted work names its
decisive next check. For completed work with current evidence, the three steps
cover only checking current state, reconciling contradictions and confirming
no material mismatch. Do not invent more work or repeat a current check to fill
a step.

Compare the full prompt with the captured facts and sources. Check required
facts, exact identifiers, source attribution, Objective fields, Receiver
Instructions and the first safe step. For a lossless request, check every
in-scope non-secret fact. Correct omissions or contradictions before returning
exactly the fenced artifact with no surrounding text, or the specified path,
hash and reading instruction for complete-file delivery. Leave no placeholders,
secrets, invented facts or tool details used only to prepare the snapshot.

Handoff owns the snapshot.

All Skills included in this suite must be installed and enabled. Use the
applicable owner without checking sibling availability. Load only instructions
needed for the task. Explicit invocation gates and user exclusions still apply.

Preserve active sibling state in the snapshot.

Reuse an already verified Python 3.11+ interpreter. Otherwise check `py -3`
on Windows or `python3` elsewhere; try `python` if needed. Choose it locally,
without asking the user. Use that executable for the `python` examples.
Report a missing runtime only when no suitable installed interpreter is found.

## Runtime helpers

Use the bundled helpers for their operations. Read their invocation instructions,
not their source, unless diagnosing a failure.

Before reading Skill references or other large inputs, apply any declared or
explicitly selected output limit. With Python, use
`<verified-python> -X utf8 "<skill-directory>/scripts/check_text_size.py" --file "<file>" --max-output-tokens <limit> --part 1`.
Follow each `next=M` label with `--part M`; read every unchanged UTF-8 part
through `last`, where end equals total. Measure the complete rendered output, including labels;
combine files or parts only when that combined output fits. Otherwise use
separate, individually checked outer tool calls; a script joining reads
returns one combined output. With no applicable limit, read
complete UTF-8 directly; do not invent a budget.
Python and every named helper are required. Missing dependencies or helper
errors stop the affected operation. Do not substitute manual execution.

Helpers: `scripts/check_text_size.py`.
