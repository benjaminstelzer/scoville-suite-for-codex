# Scoville Handoff

Continuing a task requires its current blocker, unfinished changes and relevant
decisions. Scoville Handoff gathers those facts into one compact, copy-ready
prompt with the objective, permissions and next action, so another session can
resume the work.

## How it works

- Read conversation facts and named sources, recovering incomplete reads within the user's limits.
- Capture decisions, ownership, evidence and blockers while excluding secrets.
- Organize and check one copy-ready prompt with Receiver Instructions, Objective, State and Resume Steps.
- Preserve necessary facts under length limits. The receiver checks current state before acting.

## What it enforces

- **Explicit transfer.** A requested handoff produces one continuation prompt.
- **Usable context.** Important facts from the conversation and named sources
  end up in the prompt, including blockers and unfinished work.
- **Preserved authority.** Permissions, file ownership, your own changes and
  limits on commits, publishing or destructive actions stay explicit.
- **Honest state.** Results nobody observed stay marked as unknown. Secrets
  stay out.
- **Actionable continuation.** The first Resume Step gives the next safe
  action. The last says how to confirm the work is complete.
- **A faithful snapshot.** Creating the handoff only reads and describes the
  task. It doesn't edit, test or move it forward.

## What it costs

- Reading the task state and preparing the handoff use additional tokens and time.

## How it was developed

- Handoffs between real sessions showed what tends to get lost: blockers,
  decisions and who owns local changes.
- Project histories, targeted simulations and optimization runs shaped the
  four-section template and the checks for facts a continuation needs.

In one targeted GPT-6 Luna High repeat, a preference became a requirement.
Check that distinction when continuing from a generated handoff. A later test
has not disproved this observation.

## Compatibility

Requires a frontier model from the Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus families,
version 5.0 or newer. Luna was also used in testing.

The host needs to be able to read the task sources you name. Read-only access
to version control is optional. Handoff uses no scripts, no network and no
subagents.

Developed for Codex and Claude Code. Other hosts haven't been tested.

## Install

### Install this Skill

Install this Skill as part of the complete suite from
[the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Every member must be installed and enabled. Do not fetch or substitute packages
from individual Skill repositories. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Handoff to transfer this active task to a new session. Include the current repository state and verified evidence.
```

```text
Create a compact handoff for another agent. Preserve the objective, decisions, changed files, blockers and next action. Do not continue the work.
```
