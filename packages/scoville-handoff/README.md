# Scoville Handoff

Scoville Handoff turns the current task into one copy-ready continuation
prompt: the goal, decisions, unfinished work, blockers and next action.
Another session can pick up the work without asking you to explain it all again.

Scoville measures chili heat. Handoff keeps the useful context from being
diluted between conversations. The next agent already has enough imagination.

## How it works

- Read the conversation and the task sources already named or established.
- Capture the facts needed to resume, including permissions and unfinished work.
- Produce one prompt in the requested language, otherwise the conversation
  language. The receiving agent checks current state before acting.

## What it enforces

- **Explicit transfer.** A handoff starts when you request one. Preparing it is
  read-only and does not advance the task.
- **Faithful context.** Decisions, permissions, ownership and blockers survive
  the transfer. Unknown results stay unknown, and secrets stay out.
- **A useful next action.** The prompt tells the next session where to resume
  and how to recognize completion.

A targeted GPT-6 Luna High test turned a preference into a requirement. Check
that distinction in a generated handoff. Later testing has not disproved the
observation.

## What it costs

- Preparing the prompt takes tokens and time once, so the next session has less context to reconstruct.

## How it was developed

Real transfers exposed lost blockers, decisions and ownership of unfinished
changes. Those cases shaped a compact template that preserves what the next
session needs to continue.

## Compatibility

Developed for Codex and Claude Code with read access to the task's relevant sources. Use a Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus model (5.0+).

## Install

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.

### Install this Skill

Use [the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Keep all members from the same suite. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) lists where to install it.



## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Handoff to transfer this active task to a new session. Include the current repository state and verified evidence.
```

```text
Create a compact handoff for another agent. Preserve the objective, decisions, changed files, blockers and next action. Do not continue the work.
```
