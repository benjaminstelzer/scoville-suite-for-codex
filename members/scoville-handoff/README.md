# Scoville Handoff

Continuing a task requires its current blocker, unfinished changes and relevant
decisions. Scoville Handoff gathers those facts into one compact, copy-ready
prompt with the objective, permissions and next action, so another session can
resume the work.

Here, the heat is the working context another session needs after a long conversation is condensed.

## How it works

- Read conversation facts and named sources, recovering incomplete reads within the user's limits.
- Capture decisions, ownership, evidence and blockers while excluding secrets.
- Organize and check one copy-ready prompt with Receiver Instructions, Objective, State and Resume Steps.
- Preserve necessary facts under length limits. The receiver checks current state before acting.

## What it enforces

- **Explicit transfer.** A requested handoff produces one continuation prompt.
- **Usable context.** Material facts from the conversation and named sources
  appear in the prompt, including blockers and incomplete work.
- **Preserved authority.** Permissions, file ownership, user changes and
  boundaries on commits, publication or destructive actions remain explicit.
- **Honest state.** Unobserved results remain unknown. Secrets stay out.
- **Actionable continuation.** The first Resume Step gives the next safe action.
  The last defines how to confirm completion.
- **A faithful snapshot.** Creating the handoff reads and describes the task
  without editing, testing or advancing it.

## What it costs

- Reading the task state and preparing the handoff use additional tokens and time.

## How it was developed

- Transfers between real sessions exposed missing blockers, decisions and ownership of local changes.
- Project histories, targeted simulations and optimization workflows informed the four-section template and checks for necessary continuation facts.

## Compatibility

A current Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus model is recommended. Luna was also used
in testing.

Requires an Agent Skills host that can read named task sources. Read-only
version-control inspection is optional. Handoff uses no scripts, network or
subagents.

Developed for Codex and Claude Code. Other hosts are untested.

Install and enable every Skill in the suite. Each applies to its own task scope.
Start Workflow by asking for it explicitly.

## Install

### Install this Skill

Install this Skill as part of the complete suite from
[the suite's own packages](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex/tree/main/packages).
Every member must be installed and enabled. Do not fetch or substitute packages
from individual Skill repositories. If any member is missing or incompatible,
report the incomplete installation rather than claiming the suite is ready.

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. See the
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
for host-specific locations.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

Get the complete suite from the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite-for-codex).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Handoff to transfer this active task to a new session. Include the current repository state and verified evidence.
```

```text
Create a compact handoff for another agent. Preserve the objective, decisions, changed files, blockers and next action. Do not continue the work.
```
