# Skill fix acceptance

Plan: `docs/plans/0001-skill-compliance-and-work-efficiency.md`. Astra approved the plan in consultation `SKILL-FIXPLAN-ASTRA-20260912-02`; see `skill-fix-review-2026-09-12.md`.

## Code: bounded actual reads

Paired fresh independent tool-capable agents used identical isolated fixtures and requested `gpt-6-astra` / `low`, also recorded in local host metadata. Only package path and independent fixture path differed. The fixture contained local settings, 500 retained notes, irrelevant browser data and one explicitly requested large JSONL trace. The prior truncation was supplied as scenario state; actual subsequent shell reads and edits were executed and inspected in original transcripts.

Both agents correctly changed only retry_count from 2 to 3, preserved mode, recovered the verification rule at line 450 and returned the requested trace result. Neither searched browser contents. The baseline reread the full remaining notes and raw trace, generating a 45,700-token original tool result truncated to its 7,000-token output budget. The candidate projected only the trace result and bounded its initial missing-range read (746 original output tokens), then located the rule with a targeted search (30). Both used five outer tool calls. This single pair supports improved output handling in the fixture, not a general percentage saving or reduced account quota.

Original baseline task: `01a094f2-e25e-7a41-ae50-aca0d7ecd458`, original JSONL lines 26–39. Candidate: `01a094f3-0ba7-7cf2-b660-72c0b1ae7333`, lines 26–39. Both transcripts are under `<codex-home>/sessions/2026/09/12/`, with filenames ending in those IDs. No real compaction or implicit native Skill discovery was exercised. Fixture source readback and trace projection passed; no external service or build applies.

## WordPress and UI: scheduling and owner control

Both fresh Astra Low agents used the composed WordPress and UI packages with identical instrumented sources. They added the missing switch to the shared DynAdm fixture owner before updating the consuming region. Five related edits preceded one source/measure/sight sequence; the sight event reported a fixture defect, followed by one correction and one affected verification sequence. Actual logged source changes and state snapshots were inspected. The baseline additionally ran an initial source inspection. Both preserved the simulation boundary in their answers. No check after each small edit occurred in either run, so this pair shows no measured scheduling improvement; the source change removes a verified contradictory requirement.

The fixture commands execute and log scheduling but simulate measurement and sight responses. They prove neither actual WordPress rendering nor optical, accessibility, interaction or i18n acceptance. Current UI ownership rules remained unchanged. The final fixture files and event sequences agree with the stated outcome.

Baseline task: `01a094f5-3a5e-7c20-9311-b4bd6ddb18cb`. Candidate: `01a094f5-68e5-7f21-865a-980998a9474c`. Original transcripts use the same September 12 location and UUID filename convention as above.

## Plan: three-turn context and authority exercise

Both Astra Low agents loaded missing reference contents in the initial supplied recovery scenario and read current records. With available unchanged instructions, both then observed changed Next action and readiness B from actual files; the baseline repeated reference hash checks, while the candidate reused available instructions without them. An observed same-path edit to the fixture copy of native-editing.md then caused both agents to reload that reference before reading its newly selected checks-b.json. The deliberate fixture-only source amendment was never added to repository or installed instructions.

The replacement readiness source conflicted with the unchanged local execution rules. Both agents identified that conflict instead of claiming clean readiness, and preserved the local rule's priority. Both allowed the originally authorized Codex preflight despite a Gemini-only stop, then respected the updated stop covering both providers without launching a worker. The candidate reused the unchanged read-only reference across follow-ups. This verifies read ordering, current-state recovery and restriction scope in the executed fixture; it does not simulate actual host memory loss or prove native compaction recovery.

Baseline task: `01a094f7-4c88-7393-a8fb-62d33dc7aad5`, tool records at lines 16–26 / 40 / 54–61. Candidate: `01a094f7-7477-73e2-8252-47236aac09e8`, lines 21–31 / 45–50 / 66–73. All three stages were inspected in original transcripts. No Plan transitions or acceptance claims were made by the evaluators.

## Unchanged waiting control

Task `01a094f8-beb2-7030-9cfb-dd52635dfc06` used the existing worker waiting clause. Two actual fixture invocations requested wait 60 with cursor v1: an unchanged timeout followed by a simulated user stop at v2. No status/log polling or further invocation followed. This proves scripted scheduling choices only, not real event-wait duration or interruption. Worker source remains unchanged.

## Usage and validation boundaries

Host-recorded model/effort were gpt-6-astra / low for all seven evaluators. Usage below sums unique response IDs owned by each evaluator, including all three Plan turns; cached input is a subset of input, and reasoning a subset of output. It is local usage telemetry, not independent backend attestation or account-quota accounting.

Evaluation workspaces and supplied inputs were separated by directory and explicit instructions, not by a technically enforced security sandbox. Actual tool traces were inspected for the claimed reads and fixture writes; this is not an isolation, credential-access or network-containment qualification.

| Fixture | Input before | Input after | Cached before | Cached after | Output before | Output after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code | 233266 | 221381 | 208640 | 213120 | 898 | 933 |
| WordPress/UI | 347023 | 414093 | 319232 | 383232 | 1246 | 1409 |
| Plan | 386655 | 425777 | 374016 | 413184 | 1746 | 1766 |

Waiting control used 130503 input including 128896 cached and 248 output. Single matched fixture runs have sampling and tool-batching variation; the UI and Plan candidates used more input overall despite correct targeted behavior. No broad token-reduction claim is supported. The useful measured change is Code's bounded output; Plan removed repeated reference hashing and WordPress removed the contradictory instruction. Native discovery, real compaction, browser rendering and live interruption remain unqualified.

The existing Plan suite passed 50/50 after edits. The three Skill Creator validations each stopped on the existing supported compatibility frontmatter field, which that validator does not allow. No field or validator was weakened: all three frontmatters were confirmed unchanged against baseline and parsed successfully as YAML. Changed instructions and reference links were inspected; no scripts or new references were added to the packages. All three repository diff checks passed. The native development profile validator passed after each lifecycle change.

## Local activation

Required fixture traces were inspected before activation; W-001 through W-003 were complete. All five source files matched tested candidate content after excluding only the documented fixture-only reference amendment. Existing installed targets matched the original baseline before overwrite; each target and source was checked again immediately before its write. The five changed files were copied to both existing <codex-home>/skills and <claude-home>/skills packages. All ten installed readbacks matched source bytes. Other files and personal configuration were preserved. Nothing was committed or published.

Cleanup of the former temporary test directory was rejected by automatic approval policy before execution (`blocked by policy`). Original Codex session records were never deletion targets.

## Publication on September 12

The user subsequently authorized GitHub publication. Three clean detached release worktrees carried only the five Skill edits, changelog/README updates and concise public validation summaries. Private audit records and session details were excluded from commits.

| Repository | Release | Commit | Assets |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Scoville Code | v1.0.26 | c37e660ed22d0259a43775d3202ffb6011008306 | 2 |
| Scoville Plan | v1.3.5 | 5443ab8415f39e6e1ad2286915344e6915042b77 | 14 |
| WordPress Backend UI | v1.2.3 | c55645a9a44ce1a99eb490bc63645150e2ad0740 | 2 |

GitHub branch heads, annotated tags, release bodies, visibility, asset inventories and server-reported SHA-256 digests matched the candidates. All eleven Plan Viewer binaries were verified against the prior checksum manifest and carried forward unchanged at 1.3.0. Each remote now contains one published stable release and one release-version tag. Older local version tags were removed too. Original local main branches were advanced only after their complete prepared indexes matched the published commits, preserving uncommitted audit work.

The publication auditor passed each target's release, package structure and profile checks. WordPress passed the full requested audit. No target defect was reported. No profile or sibling family repository was changed. Unchanged package LICENSE files differed only in checkout line endings from the original local copies. All five edited Skill files matched their tested sources exactly.

All three clean release worktrees were removed through Git after local synchronization. Automatic policy rejected deletion of the remaining `temp/2026-09-12-skill-publication` directory before execution. Release archives and temporary publication scripts remain there. No alternate deletion method was attempted.
